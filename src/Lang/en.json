    "about1-text1":"It was created in 2017 by a group of residents of the village of Margarites in Rethymnon. The aim was to record the life histories of the oldest residents of the Community.",
    "about1-text2":"A main motive for the archive creation was the realisation that as the generation of people who in 2017 were over 80 years old was close to the end, the living memory of historic events during the World War II, the Occupation, the civil war and to this day, is also going to be lost. At the same time, the living memory of social events and relations during the period that Margarites and the nearby communities were populous is getting lost, a time when livelihood was based on agricultural production, pottery making and when most transactions were based on product exchange. Moreover, with this generation the living memory of professions and daily life practices ends, as well as the memory of the settlement layout before the middle of the 20th century.",
    "about1-text3":"A powerful motive behind our effort was also the need to capture the speech of the people who narrate. A voice that is usually unaffected by formal education and which, as far as content, vocabulary and prosody is concerned, echoes the era of Orality, an era when knowledge, information, action, emotion and also every kind of relationship emerged and was captured through the living and continuous oral narratives of the Community.",

    "about2-text2":"Rodakas set as its primary goal the creation of the Archive of Oral History, as well as the Photographic Archive of the Margarites Community, which will be useful and convenient for research, and at the same time it will constitute a legacy and a memory deposit for the younger generation, whether they are residents or come from Margarites and the surrounding communities. The same applies to the stone and pottery workshops. Knowledge and knowhow originate in the Community, is accessible to the wider public and eventually comes back to the Community.",

    "members1-text":"I was born in Athens in 1959. My mother came from Margarites and my father from Orthe in Mylopotamos. I graduated from the Faculty of Media and Modern Greek Studies of the Philosophical School of the University of Ioannina and then I studied at the ECOLE DES HAUTES ETUDES EN SCIENCES SOCIALES, in Paris where I received the Diploma in Ethnology. I continued my postgraduate studies at PARIS 1 PANTHEON-SORBONNE University where I received the D.E.A. from the field of Byzantine and Post-Byzantine History. My research in the field of Ethnology and History was carried out with reference to the villages of Mylopotamos in Crete and especially Margarites and for this reason I started the first interviews with residents of the area in the 1980s. The subject of my research was the Habitation and Family in Mountainous and Semi-mountainous Mylopotamos. During this time, I worked as an ethnologist in research programs at Panteion University and the Museum of Cretan Ethnology, in collaboration with Christoforos Vallianos, in Voros of Heraklion, on the subject of Ceramic Art in the villages of Crete. (Especially Margarites and Thrapsano). I currently work in Public Secondary Education as a philologist since 1994 and I have two children. In the summer of 2017, I settled in Margarites and transferred to the Mylopotamos Garazos High School, of which I am still the director. One of the most important reasons for which I sought to return to my place of origin was to continue ethnographic recording, collecting oral history, family and life histories, as well as recording expertise and practices that are no longer practiced in terms of arts, the processing of products, the cultivation of the land... I also had a strong conviction that these processes should be the subject of teamwork by members of the Community itself that will be materialised in the form of archives, but also through live workshops, a way of connecting with the past, the local History and the identity of the Community itself and its members.",

His grandfather, like his father Giannis and his paternal uncles, George and Nikos, were all stonemasons and were involved in construction as well as stone sculpting. He studied with them from his childhood. He learned from a child the techniques of mining and the types of local stone, the building of the stone wall, the chiselling and the construction of doors, as well as the sculpting of the stone. He built \"with couple\" the master Giorgis Gerovasakis, in the Despotic of the Metropolis of Rethymnon, he participated in the construction of the churches of the Prophet Elias in Ancient Eleftherna, of the Holy Trinity in Angeliana, of Agios Georgios in Humeri, of Agios Spyridon in Piguniana, in the construction of the school in the village of Chonos Rethymnon. He also worked on the restoration of the Monastery of Agios Ioannis in Bali as well as on the restoration projects of the Fortezza of Rethymno and the mansion-tower of the doctor Emmanuel Mathioudakis in Angeliana. He was involved in the construction of a large number of stone-built houses until the 90s. When the use of stone as a basic building material decreased, he continued working in the reconstruction and restoration of stone structures, in pointing and plastering of stone masonry. He used local soils and experimented with them for the strength and tightness of joints and plasters. He was interested in solidity as much as the aesthetic effect and therefore used the knowledge from the tradition of his ancestors and his own great technical experience. At the same time, as he respected and always had a great interest in tradition, he created a remarkable written archive of records of his fellow villagers, but also of historical events that he experienced and that characterized his time. Yiannis Alefantinos is the last stone mason in Margarites, who knows and applies the local building techniques, which were used for centuries by the stone masons in this village, creating its excellent characteristic image. Since the first stone workshop in the summer of 2020, Yiannis Alefantinos has participated as an instructor in all the stonework restoration workshops of RODAKAS. He also took part in the research of the Margarites Oral Narratives Group for the historical recording of the families and homes of the Margarites Community and helped significantly in the realization of the documentary of the Margarites Oral Narratives Group: \"The Threshold of Memory\".",

In the settlement, due to the rich subsoil in porolite deposits, the famous Alfopetra, a stone easy to process and resistant to its use in constructions, there were developed many famous and remarkable, for the time in which each lived, masters in building with stone. In 1985, Kostas Vergianakis was taught the art of stonework by two of these \"masters\", Charalambos and Yiannis Vergianakis. Craftsmen with a significant legacy in the field of stone constructions. His acquaintance and collaboration with Manolis Skevakis, stonemason - sculptor, in 1990 pushed him to see the construction of stone from another angle, while then the professional collaboration with Konstantinos Tzanoudakis or Tzanoudokostas from the village of Langa in the municipality of Mylopotamos, master craftsman equally renowned for his building technique, he further expanded his knowledge and construction perception. Today, Kostas Vergianakis follows the same path that all the above showed him. Each one individually contributed in his own way to the formation of his character as a \"master craftsman\" with valuable construction experience. And he, in turn, tries to pass on his knowledge and the art he possesses, to anyone who is willing to learn.",

Her focus is primarily on the craft processes of textile products, feminist history, and spaces of National Socialism. Her work has been presented at DOK Leipzig, Kurzfilmtage Oberhausen, Museum der bildenden Künste in Leipzig, as well as the 5+1 Festival in Heraklion and other places.",

                    "The artistic documentary 'Tangled Threads' follows the traces of silk parachutes - from their National Socialist, propaganda production of silk to the Battle of Crete in 1941, where the silk fabrics of the parachutes were reused by women. In a place where airplanes rarely flew, 10,000 paratroopers landed on the island in May 1941.",
                    "Women in Crete recall the German terrorism during the occupation. They cut the parachutes and recycled them into scarves and dresses. These craft processes have shaped their memory and are units of time recorded on their bodies."
