Which families lived in which neighborhoods and what were their stories? How did the builders extract the stone and how was a house built by the local craftsmen? These are the topics that «The Threshold of Memory» 2019, the second documentary of the Oral History Group (Rodakas), talks about. This record is based on oral testimonies and is a journey through the public spaces and a reminiscence of the ancestral home and the childhood years of the village residents."
