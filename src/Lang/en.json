    "about1-title":"The Margarites Oral Narratives Team",
    "about1-text1":"It was created in 2017 by a group of residents of the village of Margarites in Rethymnon. The aim was to record the life histories of the oldest residents of the Community.",
    "about1-text2":"A main motive for the archive creation was the realisation that as the generation of people who in 2017 were over 80 years old was close to the end, the living memory of historic events during the World War II, the Occupation, the civil war and to this day, is also going to be lost. At the same time, the living memory of social events and relations during the period that Margarites and the nearby communities were populous is getting lost, a time when livelihood was based on agricultural production, pottery making and when most transactions were based on product exchange. Moreover, with this generation the living memory of professions and daily life practices ends, as well as the memory of the settlement layout before the middle of the 20th century.",
    "about1-text3":"A powerful motive behind our effort was also the need to capture the speech of the people who narrate. A voice that is usually unaffected by formal education and which, as far as content, vocabulary and prosody is concerned, echoes the era of Orality, an era when knowledge, information, action, emotion and also every kind of relationship emerged and was captured through the living and continuous oral narratives of the Community.",
    "about2-title":"Rodakas",
    "about2-text1":"The Community of Margarites is the connecting thread of Rodakas. The history, the people, the social/demographic, institutional and cultural changes that emerge through the narratives of its inhabitants were the first and most important common ground and interest of the group; they gave motivation and provided the inspiration for its creation and aims.",
    "about2-text2":"Rodakas set as its primary goal the creation of the Archive of Oral History, as well as the Photographic Archive of the Margarites Community, which will be useful and convenient for research, and at the same time it will constitute a legacy and a memory deposit for the younger generation, whether they are residents or come from Margarites and the surrounding communities. The same applies to the stone and pottery workshops. Knowledge and knowhow originate in the Community, is accessible to the wider public and eventually comes back to the Community.",

    "multimedia1-text":"How were the solid residential units with the tall outer walls that close 'like a pomegranate', the residences of Margarites, built? Which families lived in which neighborhoods and what were their stories? How did the builders extract the stone and how was a house built by the local craftsmen? These are the topics that \"The Threshold of Memory\" 2019, the second documentary of the Oral History Group (Rodakas), talks about. This record is based on oral testimonies and is a journey through the public spaces and a reminiscence of the ancestral home and the childhood years of the village residents.",
    "multimedia2-title":"\"Harder Years, Happier Years\"",
    "multimedia2-text":"A section of the archival material (videos, interviews, photos) from the life histories records of the older residents of Margarites was used to create the documentary \"Harder years, happier years\", focusing on the important personal relationships and the historical and social events that affected the lives of the people who narrate. The decision to make the documentary arose from the team’s need to communicate its activity and to contribute in raising awareness about the importance of storytelling and the value of memory in establishing cultural identity and social cohesion.",
