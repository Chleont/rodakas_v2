    "about1-title":"The Margarites Oral Narratives Team",
    "about1-text1":"It was created in 2017 by a group of residents of the village of Margarites in Rethymnon. The aim was to record the life histories of the oldest residents of the Community.",
    "about1-text2":"A main motive for the archive creation was the realisation that as the generation of people who in 2017 were over 80 years old was close to the end, the living memory of historic events during the World War II, the Occupation, the civil war and to this day, is also going to be lost. At the same time, the living memory of social events and relations during the period that Margarites and the nearby communities were populous is getting lost, a time when livelihood was based on agricultural production, pottery making and when most transactions were based on product exchange. Moreover, with this generation the living memory of professions and daily life practices ends, as well as the memory of the settlement layout before the middle of the 20th century.",
    "about1-text3":"A powerful motive behind our effort was also the need to capture the speech of the people who narrate. A voice that is usually unaffected by formal education and which, as far as content, vocabulary and prosody is concerned, echoes the era of Orality, an era when knowledge, information, action, emotion and also every kind of relationship emerged and was captured through the living and continuous oral narratives of the Community.",
    "about2-title":"Rodakas",
    "about2-text1":"The Community of Margarites is the connecting thread of Rodakas. The history, the people, the social/demographic, institutional and cultural changes that emerge through the narratives of its inhabitants were the first and most important common ground and interest of the group; they gave motivation and provided the inspiration for its creation and aims.",
    "about2-text2":"Rodakas set as its primary goal the creation of the Archive of Oral History, as well as the Photographic Archive of the Margarites Community, which will be useful and convenient for research, and at the same time it will constitute a legacy and a memory deposit for the younger generation, whether they are residents or come from Margarites and the surrounding communities. The same applies to the stone and pottery workshops. Knowledge and knowhow originate in the Community, is accessible to the wider public and eventually comes back to the Community.",

    "members1-text":"I was born in Athens in 1959. My mother came from Margarites and my father from Orthe in Mylopotamos. I graduated from the Faculty of Media and Modern Greek Studies of the Philosophical School of the University of Ioannina and then I studied at the ECOLE DES HAUTES ETUDES EN SCIENCES SOCIALES, in Paris where I received the Diploma in Ethnology. I continued my postgraduate studies at PARIS 1 PANTHEON-SORBONNE University where I received the D.E.A. from the field of Byzantine and Post-Byzantine History. My research in the field of Ethnology and History was carried out with reference to the villages of Mylopotamos in Crete and especially Margarites and for this reason I started the first interviews with residents of the area in the 1980s. The subject of my research was the Habitation and Family in Mountainous and Semi-mountainous Mylopotamos. During this time, I worked as an ethnologist in research programs at Panteion University and the Museum of Cretan Ethnology, in collaboration with Christoforos Vallianos, in Voros of Heraklion, on the subject of Ceramic Art in the villages of Crete. (Especially Margarites and Thrapsano). I currently work in Public Secondary Education as a philologist since 1994 and I have two children. In the summer of 2017, I settled in Margarites and transferred to the Mylopotamos Garazos High School, of which I am still the director. One of the most important reasons for which I sought to return to my place of origin was to continue ethnographic recording, collecting oral history, family and life histories, as well as recording expertise and practices that are no longer practiced in terms of arts, the processing of products, the cultivation of the land... I also had a strong conviction that these processes should be the subject of teamwork by members of the Community itself that will be materialised in the form of archives, but also through live workshops, a way of connecting with the past, the local History and the identity of the Community itself and its members.",

Which families lived in which neighborhoods and what were their stories? How did the builders extract the stone and how was a house built by the local craftsmen? These are the topics that \"The Threshold of Memory\" 2019, the second documentary of the Oral History Group (Rodakas), talks about.

It gives us admiration for the masterpiece of the craftsman and the era that gave birth to it. The techniques and experience of traditional stonework still lives in the hands of some craftsmen throughout Greece. The Rodakas team is organizing for the fourth time an effort to transmit the basic principles of traditional building in our country using natural materials. Rodakas invites you to leave your little stone at Margarites and gain the experiential knowledge that will change your relationship and your perspective towards buildings of all kinds. On your side will be the local Masters Giannis Alefantinos (Margarites) and Kostas Vergianakis with his crew (Alfa) whose biographies you will find below as well as the members and friends of the Rodakas team.",
